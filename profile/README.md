# The Rensselaer Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning (RAIR) Laboratory at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)

Research and development in the RAIR Lab ranges across a number of applied projects, as well as across many of the fundamental questions AI raises. Everything is to a high degree unified by the fact that the formalisms, tools, techniques, systems, etc. that underlie the lab's R&D are invariably based on reasoning.
